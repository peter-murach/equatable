Allows ruby objects to implement equality comparison and inspection methods.

By including this module, a class indicates that its instances have explicit general contracts for `hash`, `==` and `eql?` methods. Specifically `eql?` contract requires that it implements an equivalence relation. By default each instance of the class is equal only to itself. This is a right behaviour when you have distinct objects. Howerver, it is the responsibility of any class to clearly define their equality. Failure to do so may prevent instances to behave as expected when for instance `Array#uniq` is invoked or when they are used as `Hash` keys.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'equatable'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install equatable

## Usage

It is assumed that your objects are value objects and the only values that affect equality comparison are the ones specified by your attribute readers. Each attribute reader should be a significant field in determining objects values.

```ruby
class Value
  include Equatable

  attr_reader :value

  def initialize(value)
    @value = value
  end
end

val1 = Value.new(11)
val2 = Value.new(11)
val3 = Value.new(13)

val1 == val2            # => true
val1.hash == val2.hash  # => true
val1 eql? val2          # => true

val1 == val3            # => false
val1.hash == val3.hash  # => false
val1 eql? val3          # => false
```

It is important that the attribute readers should allow for performing deterministic computations on class instances. Therefore you should avoid specifying attributes that depend on unreliable resources like IP address that require network access.

Note that adding an extra attribute reader to a subclass will violate the equivalence contract.
